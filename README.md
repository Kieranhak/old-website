        <h1>MY POEM</h1>    
     
     <p>Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,<br>
Prevent the dog from barking with the juicy bone.<br>
Silence the pianos and, with muffled drum,<br>
Bring out the coffin. Let the mourners come.<br>
Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead<br>.
Scribbling in the sky the message: “He is dead!”<br>
Put crepe bows around the white necks of the public doves.<br>
Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.<br>

He was my north, my south, my east and west,<br>
My working week and Sunday rest,<br>
My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song.<br>
I thought that love would last forever; I was wrong.<br>

The stars are not wanted now; put out every one.<br>
Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun.<br>
Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood.<br>
For nothing now can come to any good.</p>
